If your CTF lab only contains an SQL injection challenge, the `README.md` can be simplified. Here's a revised version that focuses solely on the SQL injection challenge:

# SQL Injection CTF Lab

Welcome to the SQL Injection Challenge! This lab is designed to help you understand and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application.

## Overview

This Capture The Flag (CTF) lab focuses on exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities. SQL injection (SQLi) is one of the most common and dangerous web vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to interfere with the queries a web application makes to its database.

Your goal is to find the flag by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
